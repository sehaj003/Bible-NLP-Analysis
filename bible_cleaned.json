She named him Moses, and said, \u201cBecause I drew him out of the water.\u201d\nIn those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.\nHe looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.\nHe went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other.

Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?\u201d\nMoses was afraid, and said, \u201cSurely this thing is known.\u201d\nNow when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses.

They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father\u2019s flock.\nThe shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.\nWhen they came to Reuel, their father, he said, \u201cHow is it that you have returned so early today?\u201d\nThey said, \u201cAn Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.\u201d\nHe said to his daughters, \u201cWhere is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.\u201d\nMoses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter.\nShe bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, \u201cI have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.\u201d\nIn the course of those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.\nGod heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\nGod saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.\n",

Without him was not anything made that has been made.\nIn him was life, and the life was the light of men.\nThe light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn\u2019t overcome\n it.\nThere came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.\nThe same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.\nHe was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.\nThe true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.\nHe was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn\u2019t recognize him.\nHe came to his own, and those who were his own didn\u2019t receive him.\nBut as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God\u2019s children, to those who believe in his name:\nwho were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\nThe Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.\nJohn testified about him. He cried out, saying, \u201cThis was he of whom I said, \u2018He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.\u2019\u201d\nFrom his fullness we all received grace upon grace.\nFor the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.\nNo one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.\nThis is John\u2019s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\nHe declared, and didn\u2019t deny, but he declared, \u201cI am not the Christ.\u201d\nThey asked him, \u201cWhat then? Are you Elijah?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI am not.\u201d\n\u201cAre you the prophet?\u201d\nHe answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\nThey said therefore to him, \u201cWho are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, \u2018Make straight the way of the Lord,\u2019 as Isaiah the prophet said.\u201d\nThe ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.\nThey asked him, \u201cWhy then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?\u201d\nJohn answered them, \u201cI baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don\u2019t know.\nHe is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I\u2019m not worthy to loosen.\u201d\nThese things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\nThe next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, \u201cBehold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\nThis is he of whom I said, \u2018After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.\u2019\nI didn\u2019t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel.\u201d\nJohn testified, saying, \u201cI have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.\nI didn\u2019t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, \u2018On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.\u2019\nI have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.\u201d\nAgain, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,\nand he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, \u201cBehold, the Lamb of God!\u201d\nThe two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.\nJesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them,\n\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d\nThey said to him, \u201cRabbi\u201d (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), \u201cwhere are you staying?\u201d\nHe said to them,\n\u201cCome, and see.\u201d\nThey came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.\nOne of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter\u2019s brother.\nHe first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, \u201cWe have found the Messiah!\u201d (which is, being interpreted, Christ).\nHe brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said,\n\u201cYou are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas\u201d (which is by interpretation, Peter).\nOn the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him,\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d\nNow Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.\nPhilip found Nathanael, and said to him, \u201cWe have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\u201d\nNathanael said to him, \u201cCan any good thing come out of Nazareth?\u201d\nPhilip said to him, \u201cCome and see.\u201d\nJesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him,\n\u201cBehold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!\u201d\nNathanael said to him, \u201cHow do you know me?\u201d\nJesus answered him,\n\u201cBefore Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.\u201d\nNathanael answered him, \u201cRabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!\u201d\nJesus answered him,\n\u201cBecause I told you, \u2018I saw you underneath the fig tree,\u2019 do you believe? You will see greater things than these!\u201d\nHe said to him,\n\u201cMost certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\u201d\n",

He who doesn\u2019t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.\n\n\nThis is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.\n\n\nFor everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn\u2019t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.\n\n\nBut he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.\u201d\nAfter these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized.\nJohn also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized.\nFor John was not yet thrown into prison.\nThere arose therefore a questioning on the part of John\u2019s disciples with some Jews about purification.\nThey came to John, and said to him, \u201cRabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.\u201d\nJohn answered, \u201cA man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.\nYou yourselves testify that I said, \u2018I am not the Christ,\u2019 but, \u2018I have been sent before him.\u2019\nHe who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom\u2019s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.\nHe must increase, but I must decrease.\nHe who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.\nWhat he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.\nHe who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.\nFor he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.\nThe Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.\nOne who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys\n the Son won\u2019t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.\u201d\n",

Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.\nA woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her,\n\u201cGive me a drink.\u201d\nFor his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.\nThe Samaritan woman therefore said to him, \u201cHow is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?\u201d (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)\nJesus answered her,\n\u201cIf you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, \u2018Give me a drink,\u2019 you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.\u201d\nThe woman said to him, \u201cSir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water?\nAre you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?\u201d\nJesus answered her,\n\u201cEveryone who drinks of this water will thirst again,\n\n\nbut whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.\u201d\nThe woman said to him, \u201cSir, give me this water, so that I don\u2019t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.\u201d\nJesus said to her,\n\u201cGo, call your husband, and come here.\u201d\n\nThe woman answered, \u201cI have no husband.\u201d\nJesus said to her,\n\u201cYou said well, \u2018I have no husband,\u2019\n\n\nfor you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.\u201d\nThe woman said to him, \u201cSir, I perceive that you are a prophet.\nOur fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.\u201d\nJesus said to her,\n\u201cWoman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.\n\n\nYou worship that which you don\u2019t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.\n\n\nBut the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshipers.\n\n\nGod is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u201d\nThe woman said to him, \u201cI know that Messiah comes, he who is called Christ. When he has come, he will declare to us all things.\u201d\nJesus said to her,\n\u201cI am he, the one who speaks to you.\u201d\nAt this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d or, \u201cWhy do you speak with her?\u201d\nSo the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,\n\u201cCome, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?\u201d\nThey went out of the city, and were coming to him.\nIn the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, \u201cRabbi, eat.\u201d\nBut he said to them,\n\u201cI have food to eat that you don\u2019t know about.\u201d\nThe disciples therefore said to one another, \u201cHas anyone brought him something to eat?\u201d\nJesus said to them,\n\u201cMy food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.\n\n\nDon\u2019t you say, \u2018There are yet four months until the harvest?\u2019 Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.\n\n\nHe who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.\n\n\nFor in this the saying is true, \u2018One sows, and another reaps.\u2019\n\n\nI sent you to reap that for which you haven\u2019t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.\u201d\nFrom that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, \u201cHe told me everything that I did.\u201d\nSo when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.\nMany more believed because of his word.\nThey said to the woman, \u201cNow we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.\u201d\nAfter the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.\nFor Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.\nSo when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.\nJesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.\nWhen he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.\nJesus therefore said to him,\n\u201cUnless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.\u201d\nThe nobleman said to him, \u201cSir, come down before my child dies.\u201d\nJesus said to him,\n\u201cGo your way. Your son lives.\u201d The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.\nAs he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying \u201cYour child lives!\u201d\nSo he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, \u201cYesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.\u201d\nSo the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him,\n\u201cYour son lives.\u201d He believed, as did his whole house.\nThis is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.\n",

Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.\u201d\n\nThe man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.\nFor this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.\nBut Jesus answered them,\n\u201cMy Father is still working, so I am working, too.\u201d\nFor this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.\nJesus therefore answered them,\n\u201cMost certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.\n\n\nFor the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.\n\n\nFor as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.\n\n\nFor the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,\n\n\nthat all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn\u2019t honor the Son doesn\u2019t honor the Father who sent him.\n\n\u201cMost certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn\u2019t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.\n\n\nMost certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God\u2019s voice; and those who hear will live.\n\n\nFor as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.\n\n\nHe also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.\n\n\nDon\u2019t marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,\n\n\nand will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.\n\n\nI can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don\u2019t seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.\n\n\u201cIf I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.\n\n\nIt is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.\n\n\nYou have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.\n\n\nBut the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.\n\n\nHe was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.\n\n\nBut the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.\n\n\nThe Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have his word living in you; because you don\u2019t believe him whom he sent.\n\n\u201cYou search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.\n\n\nYet you will not come to me, that you may have life.\n\n\nI don\u2019t receive glory from men.\n\n\nBut I know you, that you don\u2019t have God\u2019s love in yourselves.\n\n\nI have come in my Father\u2019s name, and you don\u2019t receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.\n\n\nHow can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don\u2019t seek the glory that comes from the only God?\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.\n\n\nFor if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.\n\n\nBut if you don\u2019t believe his writings, how will you believe my words?\u201d\n",

Having turned, I saw seven golden lamp stands.\nAnd among the lamp stands was one like a son of man, clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.\nHis head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.\nHis feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.\nHe had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.\nWhen I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man.\nHe laid his right hand on me, saying,\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I am the first and the last,\n\n\nand the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever. Amen. I have the keys of Death and of Hades.\n\nWrite therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;\n\n\nthe mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamp stands. The seven stars are the angels\nof the seven assemblies. The seven lamp stands are seven assemblies.\n",

To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of my God.\n\n\u201cTo the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write:\n\u201cThe first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life says these things:\n\n\u201cI know your works, oppression, and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.\n\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.\n\n\nHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He who overcomes won\u2019t be harmed by the second death.\n\n\u201cTo the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write:\n\u201cHe who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things:\n\n\u201cI know your works and where you dwell, where Satan\u2019s throne is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn\u2019t deny my faith in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.\n\n\nBut I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.\n\n\nSo you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans likewise.\n\nRepent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.\n\n\nHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna,\n\nand I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.\n\n\u201cTo the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write:\n\u201cThe Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things:\n\n\u201cI know your works, your love, faith, service, patient endurance, and that your last works are more than the first.\n\n\nBut I have this against you, that you tolerate your\nwoman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.\n\n\nI gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.\n\n\nBehold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent of her works.\n\n\nI will kill her children with Death, and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.\n\n\nBut to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as don\u2019t have this teaching, who don\u2019t know what some call \u2018the deep things of Satan,\u2019 to you I say, I am not putting any other burden on you.\n\n\nNevertheless, hold that which you have firmly until I come.\n\n\nHe who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end, to him I will give authority over the nations.\n\n\nHe will rule them with a rod of iron, shattering them like clay pots;\nas I also have received of my Father:\n\n\nand I will give him the morning star.\n\n\nHe who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.\n",
